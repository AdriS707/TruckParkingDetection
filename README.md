# TruckParkingDetection

![Starting Image](start-image.png)

This repository is based on a project executed by Michael Fixl, Josef Hinterleitner, [Felix Krause](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-krause-7a643b222) und [Adrian Sei√ü](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-sei%C3%9F) at the Vienna University of Economics and Business in collaboration with [Trustbit](trustbit.tech).

The notebooks cointained correspond to the following tasks:

0. Script to manual filter satellite images and labels based on a list of coordinates (GeoPandas)
1. Combine several white- and blacklists from manual filtering to one csv containing coordinates and an id
2. Create training data (XML file with pixel values of bounding box)
3. Create training data for polygonal labels
    1. Save information in one JSON (only necessary for object detection, not in repo yet)
    2. Save information as masks
4. Train image segmentation models (U-Net, Linknet, FPN and PSPNet) in a simple baseline setting
5. Training to fine-tune the best performing model of 4.
